Need tensorflow, keras 1.2, h5py, probably a lot of other stuff too lol 
RecP.py builds and saves the model as 'plant_model.h5'

Used as reference
https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-class-classification-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library/

model.py loads the model and can be used to make predictions
make an array of type [None, 4]
run model.predict(array)
